1.Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry:

software engineering is the process of for developing, building, testing and maintaining computer applications.
reliability- it ensures software performs as expected under potential failure. 
efficiency - it measures how well a system uses resources.
 scalability and flexibility - it ensures that the system can handle an increased load without affecting performance.
 security - implement protection practice like authentication, authorization and encryption to secure users information.

2.Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.  
.mastering complexity
- Agile Methodologies
- Object-orientated Programming
- Change implementation
