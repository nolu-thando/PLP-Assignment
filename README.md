# PLP-Assignment
#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

1.Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry:

software engineering is the process of for developing, building, testing and maintaining computer applications.
reliability- it ensures software performs as expected under potential failure. 
efficiency - it measures how well a system uses resources.
 scalability and flexibility - it ensures that the system can handle an increased load without affecting performance.
 security - implement protection practice like authentication, authorization and encryption to secure users information.

2.Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.  
.mastering complexity
- Agile Methodologies
- Object-orientated Programming
- Change implementation
- 
List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
 planning - identify the problem and its solution. The technologies you will you to carry out the project and the timeline.
 requirement analysis - The softwares and tools you will need. 
design - drawing or using methods that will help you have an idea of what you want your application or solution to look like or what you want it to do.
coding - converting software design into code that can be used anytime.
 testing - examine the software for any bugs and glitches and its responsiveness.
